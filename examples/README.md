# Appa Examples

This directory contains example files for use with the Python scripts available.

## [`example.bf`](example.bf)

This is a simple Brainf*ck script to print `Hello World!`. It was generated using the generator
found [here](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/text.html). It was also used to generate the Appa source
code found in the [example.appa](example.appa) file.

## [`example.appa`](example.appa)

This is an example of a Appa script to print `Hello World!`. It was generated using the
[convert_to_appa.py](/convert_to_appa.py) script found in the root of this repository. It was then
cleaned up to be under 80 characters for each line. This functionality is not included in the
converter yet.
